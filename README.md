**This repository contains an overview of a data modeling project I completed for DSC 80 at UC San Diego.** , 

## Framing the Problem

My model will be a classification model which predicts recipe ratings based on the features "minutes" and "n_steps".

### Feature Types

- Ratings: Categorical Ordinal
- Minutes: Quantitative Discrete
- N_steps: Quantitaticve Discrete
